Context
At W Company, matching is the core that connects our entire ecosystem. Improving its quality and relevance allows us to enhance the experience for both clients and talents, increase marketplace efficiency, and boost the impact of each business unit. Within this framework, the Growth team is responsible for designing and validating experiments in an agile manner to better understand user behavior and, thereby, maximize the platform's impact and performance.

3. Hypothesis
Currently, the relevance-based order within Eval (the page displaying suggested freelancers who submitted a proposal for the project) uses a very outdated logic and does not reflect the freelancer's actual relevance.
If we generate a relevance-based order that genuinely ranks freelancers from best to worst in the Eval, we will make it easier for the client to select the freelancer for their project, directly impacting conversion.

4. Actionable or Intervention
An A/B was implemented to test a different relevance-based related to the current one.

5. Business Definitions

EL1: When the client replies to a message, whether it's a proposal or an inquiry, through the messaging system.

Bid: Proposals submitted by freelancers.

Thread: Conversations maintained between clients and freelancers.

Messages: Messages exchanged between clients and freelancers within a conversation.

Accepted Bids: Proposals accepted by clients.

Gamification: Freelancer category within the platform, where levels from best to worst are ordered as follows:

Hero

Platinum

Gold

Silver

Bronze

Iron

Client Type:

New = Projects created while a client has never made a payment

Rebuy = From the moment they paid for their first project onward


6. Project Challenge 

Define a primary success metric to evaluate the experiment's impact.

Propose other complementary metrics worth monitoring to understand user behavior.

Analyze the experiment results: Do you observe relevant differences between the control group and the test group? Are there unexpected findings or interesting patterns?

Conclusion and decision-making: What can we conclude based on the results? Would you move forward with this solution, iterate on it, or discard it?

Propose next steps: How would you continue? What hypotheses or segments would you explore in a second stage? Can you think of a way to improve the scope or general approach of the experiment?
